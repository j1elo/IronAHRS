#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib")

Left click "Tools > Options", choose "Text Editor > C/C++ > Advanced", scroll down until "Fallback Location" appears. Make "Always use Fallback Location" and "Do Not Warn if Fallback Location" to be "True".

Addition: AFAIK Visual C++ Express does not includes Platform SDK, so if you can't find library on your computer you should download and install
Platform SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx?wt.svl=more_downloads)
and add necessary folders in
Visual Studio "VC++ Directories" property page (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t9az1d21%28VS.90%29.aspx).
